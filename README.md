To use on Windows simply set the .bat as default program to open the .dicks file the browser extension downloads, both (.py and .bat) must be in the same folder

If you're on Linux figure it out like you always do

### Requirements
-[python 3.8.0+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) (haven't tested with earlier versions but should work quite far back)
