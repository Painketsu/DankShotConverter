# DankShotConverter
Converts the segments from [DankShot](https://github.com/Painketsu/DankShot) into a local .ts file

To use on Windows simply set the .bat as default program to open the downloaded .dicks file, both (.py and .bat) must be in the same folder

If you're on Linux figure it out like you always do

### Requirements
-python 3.8.0+ (haven't tested with earlier versions but should work quite far back)

-ffmpeg
